\arguments{
\item{f}{The vector field function. It should return \verb{c(<dx/dt>, <dy/dt>)}}

\item{lims}{The limits of the range for the estimation as \verb{c(<xl>, <xu>, <yl>, <yu>)}.}

\item{n_path_int}{The number of equally spaced points in each axis, at which the path integrals is to be calculated.}

\item{stepsize}{The time step used in each iteration.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance to test convergence.}

\item{numTimeSteps}{Number of time steps for integrating along each path (to ensure uniform arrays). Choose high-enough number for convergence with given stepsize.}

\item{...}{Not in use.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{numPaths} Integer. Total Number of paths for defined grid spacing.
\item \code{pot_path} Matrix. Potential along the paths.
\item \code{path_tag} Vector. Tag for given paths.
\item \code{attractors_pot} Vector. Potential value of each identified attractor by the path integral approach.
\item \code{x_path} Vector. x-coord. along path.
\item \code{y_path} Vector. y-coord. along path.
}
}
